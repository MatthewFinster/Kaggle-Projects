# Kaggle Projects 📊

This repository showcases my journey through **Kaggle competitions** and data science projects. Each project involves end-to-end analysis, modelling, and visualisations.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `ProjectName/`: Each Kaggle competition or dataset has its own folder.
  - `data/`: Placeholder for datasets (not uploaded due to Kaggle's policies).
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building.
  - `scripts/`: Python/R scripts for reusable code.
  - `results/`: Outputs, figures, or any other results generated during the project.
  - `dashboards/`: Power BI dashboards or other visualisation tools used for storytelling.
  - `README.md`: A description of the project, methodology, and results.
